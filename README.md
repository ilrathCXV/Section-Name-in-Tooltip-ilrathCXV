# Show Item Section Names in Item Tooltips - MODDER'S RESOURCE
Simply put, this shows what an item's section name is in the tooltip. Useful for modders so they don't have to comb through files to find what they are looking to edit.

This is monkeypatched, so it will add it to the end of the description seamlessly. This is also useful if you come across an item you can't find in the debug spawner (i.e. Firewood for the Placeable Campfires).
